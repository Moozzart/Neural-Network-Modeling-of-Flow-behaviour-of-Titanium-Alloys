# Neural-Network-Modeling-of-Flow-behaviour-of-Titanium-Alloys
This Project had been the undertaken by Utkarsh Pratap Singh, Aniket Niranjan Mishra and Saurabh Singh, under Prof. Sumantra Mandal, Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. Data was scrapped from the related research papers and sources of Titanium alloys flow behavior and a Neural Network framework was developed to model the appropriate flow behavior of those alloys. The data comprise of the composition of different alloys, temperature at which flow stress is calculated, strain and strain rateto predict the flow stress.
The training was done on the the data points that we scrapped from papers and due to insufficient data to test we opted for testing the model by calculating the flow stress at the points in between the training data point pair of flow stress and strain and results were good and followed the pattern of the curve as shown in Results__.jpeg
